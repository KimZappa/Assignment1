d)Branches are pointers that allow you to move through different commits. The default one 
is the master that points to the last commit you make. As you continue to make new 
commits the master branch will continue to move to the last one you made. You can 
create a new branch to isolate work on a certain problem or feauture independently 
from the rest of the project. After working on the new branch you can revert
back to the work you were doing before by going back to the master branch. 

e) git log shows the commit logs made on the project. 
git status shows the working tree status, whether the project is up to date.
